# KillGarena
The Garena launcher has a background service running all the time even when the launcher is closed. No one knows what this service does and the launcher seems to work fine without it. I wrote this service to kill Garena's service automatically because I don't trust them.


# Install instructions
1. Download a release zip file from the [releases page](https://github.com/SadmanTariq/kill-garena/releases/).
2. Extract it to a suitable location. Make sure that this location is final as you will have to uninstall first before moving.
3. Run `Install.bat`.

Run `Uninstall.bat` to uninstall.
